My Emacs configuration.

The file init.example.el is an example of how to use the configuration.

The core configuration is in config.org, which contains its own documentation.

The core can be extended by =load=-ing extra .el files, which are documented below.

* calendar-sv.el
Calendar, date, and time config with a few Swedish tweaks.

The function =sv-easter= was pretty much copied from https://bigwalter.net/daniel/elisp/sv-kalender.el
* theme-doom.el
Emacs doom-theme with doom-modeline.
* keybindings.el
Global keybindings.
* org.el
Org-mode.

Note sure about
: (setq org-agenda-prefer-last-repeat t)
Removed it for now.

* python.el
